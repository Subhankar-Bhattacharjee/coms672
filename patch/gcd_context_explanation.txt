### Explanation:

The function gcd(a, b) takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their greatest common divisor. 
The problem with this function is that the base-case check is reversed. 
That is, the function checks if b == 0. 
In this case, if b == 0, then the function should return a, not 0. 
The problem is that there is a loop in the code, which makes the function recursive, and the function can be called with the same arguments multiple times. 
This will result in infinite recursion, and a maximum recursion depth error. 



### Solution:
The solution is to switch the base-case and recursion branches.
