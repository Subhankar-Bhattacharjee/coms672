You are a smart assistant helping to identify buggy code.

Task:
Given AST of the code and an issue report, identify the most buggy function name, and its buggy line number.

Respond in this exact format:
Function: <function_name>
Buggy Line Number: <line_number>

Only include the above. Do not explain or add extra text.

Here is the issue report:
Appends nested lists as whole elements rather than recursing into them.

Here is the AST structure:
Module (line None): 
    FunctionDef (line 1): def flatten(arr):
        arguments (line None): 
            arg (line 1): def flatten(arr):
        For (line 2):     for x in arr:
            Name (line 2):     for x in arr:
                Store (line None): 
            Name (line 2):     for x in arr:
                Load (line None): 
            If (line 3):         if isinstance(x, list):
